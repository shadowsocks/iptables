TODO List for netfilter / iptables. 
Currently maintained by Harald Welte <laforge@gnumonks.org>

Please inform me, if you want to work on any of the TODO items, so I
can update this list and thus prevent two people doing the same work.

CVS ID: $Id: TODO,v 1.18 2001/01/24 12:33:49 laforge Exp $

IMPORTANT before iptables-1.2.1 release:
X generic tcp sequence number offset support for nat helpers [HW]
- prerelease make target (for applying certain p-o-m stuff)
- header files in seperate directory, build all extensions, even
  when current kernel not patched
X restore counters for individual rules (iptables / iptables-restore) [HW]
- add libipulog / libiptc to DEVEL target

INDEPENDENT from iptables-1.2.1 release:
- netlink interface for conntrack manipulation from userspace [HW]
- unified nfnetlink for queue,ulog,conntrack (and more?) (2.5 issue)
- sysctl support for ftp-multi, irc-conntrack/nat, ftp-fxp
- integrate HOPLIMIT for ipv6 in patch-o-matic [HW]
- static 1:1 NAT (only ip address NAT in both directions)
- u32 classifier (port from tc -> iptables)
- pktlen match (not needed, when u32 available)
- SMP locking for IRC buggy?
- MARK match / target with boolean OR / AND (to use nfmark bitwise)
X full tcp window tracking incompatibility with nat helpers [HW]
X multiple related connections [HW]
- documentation for libiptc
- port conntrack to IPv6 (code reuse?)
- port matches (owner, limit, multiport, owner) to IPv6
- HOPLIMIT IPv6 target / match [HW]
- multicast connection tracking
- conntrack / nat failover [HW]
- Hard lockup with ip_queue under heavy load
- mangle table should use all five netfilter hooks
- make patch-o-matic more generic (any subdir), and reversible
- CONFIG_NF_IP_NAT_LOCAL
- fix and test the netfilter bridging stuff
- integrate the ipt_NETLINK target from gianni@ecsc.co.uk
- various NAT performance optimizations possible! (which? ask HW)
