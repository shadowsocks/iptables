This target will strip TCP options off a TCP packet. (It will actually replace
them by NO-OPs.) As such, you will need to add the \fB-p tcp\fR parameters.
.TP
\fB--strip-options\fR \fIoption\fR[\fB,\fR\fI...\fR]
Strip the given option(s). The options may be specified by TCP option number or
by symbolic name. The list of recognized options can be obtained by calling
iptables with \fB-j TCPOPTSTRIP -h\fR.
