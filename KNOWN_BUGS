Known bugs with the 2.4.0 kernel:

1) NAT in the OUTPUT chain does not work in general.  The fix is
   intrusive, and means we will have a CONFIG_NF_IP_NAT_LOCAL option
   when it comes back.

2) tcpdump traffic is corrupted by OUTPUT NAT.

3) Connection tracking doesn't wait very long for reply FIN, meaning
   that half-closed pipes can time out early (seen frequently with squid).

4) iptables-restore and -save still have problems. Sorry.
